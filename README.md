I used kadane's algorithm. my thought was a subarray with sum less than 0 will always reduce our answer and this type of subarray cannot be a part of the subarray with maximum sum.i ran a loop to iterate the array. we'll keep on adding the elements to the sum variable and consider the maximum one. if at any point, sum becomes negative, we'll set the sum to 0. time complexity will be O(N).
